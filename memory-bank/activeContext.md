# Active Context: Python Janus Client

## Current Focus

### Primary Task: Memory Bank Initialization
**Status:** In Progress  
**Started:** 2025-10-22  
**Goal:** Create comprehensive Cline Memory Bank for project continuity

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created memory-bank directory structure
- ✅ Wrote projectbrief.md (foundation document)
- ✅ Wrote productContext.md (why and how)
- ✅ Wrote systemPatterns.md (architecture)
- ✅ Wrote techContext.md (technical setup)
- 🔄 Writing activeContext.md (current state)
- ⏳ Need to write progress.md (project status)

## Recent Work

### TextRoom Plugin Development
**Status:** Completed (v0.8.1)  
**Key Features:**
- WebRTC data channel communication
- Room management (create, destroy, list)
- Participant management (join, leave, kick)
- Message sending (private, public, announcements)
- Event-driven architecture with callbacks
- Comprehensive error handling

**Files Modified:**
- `janus_client/plugin_textroom.py` - Main implementation
- `tests/test_plugin_textroom.py` - Test suite
- `docs/plugins.md` - Documentation

**Key Decisions:**
- Used data channels instead of WebSocket for messages
- Event-driven callbacks for real-time updates
- Enum-based event types for type safety
- Separate setup phase for WebRTC connection

### Migration from Poetry to Hatch
**Status:** Completed  
**Impact:** Development workflow changed  
**Benefits:**
- Better PEP 517/518 compliance
- Simpler configuration
- Integrated testing across Python versions
- Modern tooling

**Breaking Changes:** None for end users, only developer workflow

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### 1. WebSocket Cleanup Issue
**Problem:** WebSocket connections don't clean up properly in some scenarios  
**Impact:** Resource leaks in long-running applications  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Next Steps:**
- Investigate connection lifecycle
- Add proper cleanup handlers
- Test with long-running sessions
- Document workarounds if needed

### 2. Deprecation Warnings
**Problem:** Some dependencies emit deprecation warnings  
**Source:** Primarily from mkdocs-autorefs  
**Impact:** Low (warnings only, no functional issues)  
**Current Workaround:** Suppress in documentation build  
**Next Steps:**
- Monitor dependency updates
- Update when fixes available
- Consider alternatives if needed

### 3. Optional WebRTC Dependency
**Idea:** Make aiortc optional for signaling-only use cases  
**Benefit:** Lighter installation for apps that only need signaling  
**Challenge:** Significant refactoring required  
**Priority:** Low (future enhancement)  
**Considerations:**
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Clear documentation on when WebRTC is needed
- Separate plugin implementations?

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Plugin pattern:** Each plugin is self-contained with clear lifecycle
- **Async-first:** All I/O operations use async/await
- **Context managers:** Preferred for resource management
- **Type hints:** Required for all public APIs
- **Error handling:** Specific exceptions with clear messages

### Testing Approach
- **Integration tests:** Test against real Janus server when possible
- **Mocking:** Mock transport and WebRTC for unit tests
- **Coverage:** Maintain >80% coverage
- **Async tests:** Use pytest-asyncio markers
- **Fixtures:** Reusable test fixtures in conftest.py

### Documentation Style
- **Google-style docstrings:** Consistent format
- **Concise:** Brief but complete
- **Examples:** Include working code examples
- **Auto-generation:** Use mkdocstrings for API docs
- **Strict mode:** Always build docs with --strict flag

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes in feature branch
2. Run tests locally: `hatch test -i py=3.8`
3. Check coverage: `hatch test -i py=3.8 -c`
4. Build docs: `hatch run docs-build`
5. Commit with clear message
6. Create PR with description

## Project Insights & Learnings

### WebRTC Complexity
- WebRTC is inherently complex with many moving parts
- Proper cleanup is critical to avoid resource leaks
- Connection state monitoring is essential
- ICE candidate handling can be tricky (trickle vs full)

### Async Challenges
- Mixing async and sync code requires care
- aiortc uses threads internally (unavoidable)
- Proper exception handling in async code is crucial
- Context managers help ensure cleanup

### Plugin Architecture Benefits
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to add new plugins
- Each plugin manages its own state
- Session provides common infrastructure

### Transport Abstraction
- WebSocket preferred for performance
- HTTP long-polling as reliable fallback
- Protocol detection from URL is convenient
- Each transport has unique challenges

### Testing Insights
- Integration tests are valuable but can be flaky
- Mock carefully to avoid false positives
- Test error paths, not just happy paths
- Async tests need special attention

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: WebSocket Cleanup
**Symptom:** Connections not properly closed in some scenarios  
**Workaround:** Explicitly call disconnect() if needed  
**Status:** Investigating  
**Tracking:** TODO in README.md

### Issue 2: Deprecation Warnings
**Symptom:** Warnings during documentation build  
**Workaround:** Suppress with `-W ignore::DeprecationWarning:mkdocs_autorefs`  
**Status:** Monitoring dependency updates  
**Impact:** None (warnings only)

### Issue 3: Test Flakiness
**Symptom:** Occasional test failures in WebRTC connection tests  
**Cause:** Network timing, server availability  
**Workaround:** Retry failed tests, use longer timeouts  
**Status:** Acceptable for integration tests
